Please choose the issue type that best matches your request.

## Pull Request Workflow

ZSphere uses GitHub pull requests to manage code and documentation contributions.

Recommended workflow:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch from the latest `main` branch.
3. Make your changes in the new branch.
4. Add or update tests when applicable.
5. Update documentation when behavior changes.
6. Run local checks before submitting.
7. Push your branch to your fork.
8. Open a pull request against the upstream repository.
9. Respond to review comments and update the pull request as needed.

Please keep each pull request focused on a single topic. Large changes should be discussed in an issue before implementation.

## Branch Naming

Use clear branch names that describe the purpose of the change.

Examples:

- `fix/vm-start-timeout`
- `feature/vmware-migration-check`
- `docs/update-installation-guide`
- `test/add-storage-unit-tests`

## Commit Messages

Use clear and descriptive commit messages.

Recommended format:

- `component: short description`

Examples:

- `vm: fix instance start timeout handling`
- `docs: update quick start guide`
- `storage: add validation for primary storage capacity`

Avoid vague messages such as:

- `fix bug`
- `update code`
- `change files`

## Pull Request Description

A pull request should describe:

- What changed
- Why the change is needed
- How the change was tested
- Related issues
- Compatibility or upgrade impact
- Screenshots for UI changes, if applicable

If the pull request fixes an issue, link it in the description.

Example:

- `Fixes #123`

## Tests

Please run relevant tests before submitting a pull request.

Depending on the repository, tests may include:

- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Build checks
- Documentation checks
- Static analysis
- Installation or upgrade verification

If tests cannot be run locally, explain why in the pull request.

## Documentation

Documentation changes are welcome.

Please update documentation when:

- User-facing behavior changes
- Installation steps change
- Configuration options are added or removed
- APIs are added, changed, or deprecated
- Troubleshooting steps are discovered
- Migration or upgrade behavior changes

Documentation should be clear, accurate, and easy to follow.

## Code Review

Maintainers review pull requests for correctness, maintainability, compatibility, security, and project direction.

A pull request may require changes before it can be merged.

Please keep discussion respectful and focused on the technical topic.

## Compatibility

ZSphere is infrastructure software. Compatibility matters.

When making changes, consider:

- Upgrade compatibility
- API compatibility
- Configuration compatibility
- Data migration impact
- Deployment and rollback impact
- Integration impact with other components

Breaking changes should be clearly documented and discussed before implementation.

## Security

Do not include secrets, private keys, credentials, customer data, or internal-only information in issues, pull requests, commits, logs, or screenshots.

If you find a security vulnerability, follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
